# Reds_Py_Lib
The Red's_Python_Library contains some useful code, which I use in my other projects.

You need this if you want to run some of my other Projects, but they will tell you, if you have not
installed Red's_Python_Library yet.

If you find something useful in there for your own project, feel free to use the library in your code.

More information about the modules included with this library can be found at the Wiki page.
